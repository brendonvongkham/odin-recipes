<!--These are the steps to make the carbonara-->

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>

    <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</p></li>

    <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</p></li>

    <li><h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</p></li>

    <li><h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</p></li>

    <li><h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</p></li>

</ol>
