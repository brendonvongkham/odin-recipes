DirectionsInstructions Checklist
Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.

Step 2
Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan, and stir in grits. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer about 5 minutes, until liquid has been absorbed. Mix in 1/2 the butter and 2 cups cheese until melted.

Step 3
In a skillet over medium-high heat, cook the sausage until evenly browned. Drain, and mix into the grits. Beat together the eggs and milk in a bowl, and pour into the skillet. Lightly scramble, then mix into the grits.

Step 4
Pour the grits mixture into the prepared baking dish. Dot with remaining butter, and top with remaining cheese. Season with salt and pepper.

Step 5
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
