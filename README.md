# odin-recipes
This is my first project following The Odin Project. It will be a 
basic recipe website consisting of all the foundations I have learned so far. I will be creating basic webpages that have images and hyperlinks. This will showcase my knowledge so far of basic HTML tags, working with GitHub repositories, and show one of my favorite dishes!
